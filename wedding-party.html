    <h3>Jenn Eisenberg</h3>

    <p>
        If it weren’t for Jenn, the chances that Marla and Matt would have met would be highly improbable. Marla has
        been
        great friends with Jenn since freshman year of high school, but their paths were meant to cross even before that
        when Jenn’s mom fortuitously saw a picture of Marla on Marla’s mom’s desk years before and noted the striking
        similarity between the two awkward looking preteens. Jenn also happens to be Matt’s first cousin. She can
        usually be
        seen biking the streets of New York City, bringing dance education into public schools, or contorting her body
        in
        ways that don’t seem humanly possible on a yoga mat.

    <h3>Kristen Lombardo</h3>

    <p>
        Marla and Kristen have been close friends since they were both nine years old and grew up on the same street.
        Over
        time, their friendship became stronger throughout high school and NYU (which they both attended and were
        roommates
        senior year). Kristen has been an amazing friend to Marla over the years and they have been through many of
        life’s
        fortunes and misfortunes together. At any given time Kristen can be found somewhere in the United States
        travelling
        for her job in television production, drinking a healthy glass of wine, or keeping up to date on the latest
        celebrity gossip.

    <h3>Christina Bach</h3>

    <p>
        During medical school orientation week, Marla found Christina heading to the beach and decided to join her. It’s
        a
        good thing she did because she ended up becoming one of Marla’s closest friends, and Marla isn’t sure how she
        could
        have survived Grenada without her. Over four years of med school they continued to stay close and enjoyed living
        in
        NYC for rotations where they do a lot of eating and shopping. Marla is so excited and honored to be part of
        Christina’s wedding in May. Christina likes pandas, binge watching Law & Order, and cupcakes. She’ll be starting
        her
        residency in Internal Medicine in Buffalo in the summer!

    <h3>Lee Semel</h3>

    <p>
        Lee is Matt’s older brother of five and a half years and is one of the strongest influences in Matt’s life. When
        the
        family got a video camera in the mid 80’s, Lee started making videos, which Matt emulated, and eventually ended
        up
        being his career choice. Lee is a talented artist, and photographer. Lee can be found taking photos of
        unsuspecting
        subjects on the streets of NYC, so watch out!

    <h3>Shawn Koonin</h3>

    <p>
        Matt and Shawn have been friends since third grade, when Shawn’s family moved to NJ from South Africa, via
        Toronto.
        Shawn and Matt share a love of games and knowing random Simpsons quotes. Shawn can be seen on the streets of
        Brooklyn looking impeccably dressed or recording his music.

    <h3>Doug Letterman</h3>

    <p>
        Doug and Matt became friends sophomore year of college, and quickly realized that they had many of the same
        interests. Doug helped introduce Matt to camping and hiking, and the two of them have traveled cross-country, to
        Nepal, Patagonia, and countless trips to the Adirondacks. Matt frequently finds himself in life-threatening
        situations with Doug Letterman. Doug enjoys ultra marathons, tandem bike riding with his wife, and reading about
        catastrophic technological failures.

    <h3>Miguel Drake-McLaughlin</h3>

    <p>
        Early on at NYU, Matt and Miguel met, and have been friends ever since. They have worked together on countless
        film
        projects for the past 17 years, been roommates for five years, and are now business partners at Cowboy Bear
        Ninja.
        Miguel is an extremely talented cinematographer. Usually found in an epic wool sweater, Miguel can be seen rock
        climbing, cooking up Michelin star-worthy meals, or cycling the streets of Brooklyn.
