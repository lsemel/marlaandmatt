<h2>This is how we met</h2>
<p>Marla and Matt first shared a quick hello in the winter of 2008 while Matt was eating an empanada in a Santa suit.
    Four months later they both happened to attend a dance performance of Jenn’s (Matt’s cousin and Marla’s high school
    friend) and both had a feeling Jenn wanted them to sit together. That night, they shared their first of many Shake
    Shack fries. Five years later, including two years of long distance, they can’t wait to spend the rest of their
    lives together.

<h2>This is how we got engaged</h2>
<p>
    In June 2013, Marla was studying for Step 2 of her medical licensing exams. Most people who know Marla know that she
    gets completely “in the zone” when it comes to studying and resides in the library for the majority of the day. Matt
    decided that it might be tricky to get Marla out of the library at this time, so he had Marla’s friend Christina
    invite her for a “partner study session” at a local coffee shop, Vineapple in Brooklyn Heights. When Marla showed up
    at Vineapple, it was Matt and not Christina who was there. Marla had a feeling something was up, but Matt simply
    told her he wanted her to take a quick study break to clear her mind. They took a walk over to near the Brooklyn
    Bridge,
    got some ice cream, and walked over to the Brooklyn Heights Promenade. This is where Matt got down on one knee, with
    the New York skyline behind him, and asked Marla to be his wife. She of course said yes. Afterwards, they went to
    celebrate with dinner at Blue Hill at Stone Barns in Pocantico Hills, NY.

<h2>Marla Facts</h2>
<p>
    Marla was born and raised in New Jersey by two wonderful parents. During childhood and adolescence she realized
    she was more of an urban dweller and moved to New York City to attend NYU for college where she mastered the art
    of dodging hipsters and avoiding an empty subway car on an otherwise crowded train. She likes
    blazers, dogs, and tacos. She dislikes slow walkers, the right wing, and cold weather. Marla will be starting her
    residency in pediatrics at Goryeb Children’s Hospital in July 2014.

<h2>Matt Facts</h2>

<p>
    Matt was also born and raised in New Jersey, only about ten miles away from where Marla grew up. He also moved to NY
    to attend Tisch School of the Arts at NYU for film. He likes camping, hiking, running, the outdoors, traveling to
    weird places, and making films, especially silly ones. Matt is a partner in the NYC-based production company, Cowboy
    Bear Ninja.
